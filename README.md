### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

Through this project, I gained valuable experience in responsive web design and improved my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also learned how to effectively manage project timelines and troubleshoot issues.
"During the project, I gained a deeper understanding of list styling by learning about markers on <ul> and <li> elements. By experimenting with different CSS properties, such as list-style-type, I discovered how to customize bullet points and numbering styles for unordered and ordered lists. This knowledge allowed me to create visually appealing and well-organized content structures, improving the overall user experience of the project."

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
ul li::marker{
    color:hsl(14, 45%, 36%) ;
}
ol li::marker{
    color: hsl(14, 45%, 36%);
    font-family: "Outfit", sans-serif;
    font-weight: 700;
}
```

### Continued development

Will make this again with react and add more interactivity to it.

### Useful resources

- [Table resources styling](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_table_styling.asp) - This helped me in styling the nutrition table. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [::marker resource](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/sel_marker.php) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand styling list items for this particular project. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
